The project is runnable and buildable through unityeditor,
of which all you have to do is click "Add" with the arrow,
add project from disk, and select inside of the dc home directory.

All of my scripts are located inside of the following files:
Scripts
Characters/Player
Scenes (These are not commented due to being extremely basic or
unused)
Editor (this is a dungeon editor, allowing for me to mess with 
editor features)
And Assets

All of the dungeon functionality and generation is
integrated in unity under the SampleScene scene,
which is located in "Scenes"
